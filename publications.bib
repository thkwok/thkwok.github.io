  abstract={Liquid Metal Jet Printing (LMJP) is a revolutionary three-dimensional (3D) printing technique in fast but low-cost additive manufacturing. The driving force is produced by magneto-hydrodynamic property of liquid metal in an alternating magnetic field. Due to its integrated melting and ink-jetting process, it can achieve 10x faster speed at 1/10th of the cost as compared to current metal 3D printing techniques. However, the jetting process is influenced by many uncertain factors, which impose a significant challenge to its process stability and product quality. To address this challenge, we present a closed-loop control framework by seamlessly integrating vision-based technique and neural network tool to inspect droplet behaviours and accordingly stabilize the printing process. This system automatically tunes the drive voltage applied to compensate the uncertain influence based on vision inspection result. To realize this, we first extract multiple features and properties from images to capture the droplet behaviour. Second, we use a neural network together with PID control process to determine how the drive voltage should be adjusted. We test this system on a piezoelectric-based ink-jetting emulator, which has a very similar jetting mechanism to the LMJP. Results show that significantly more stable jetting behavior can be obtained in real-time. This system can also be applied to other droplet related applications owing to its universally applicable characteristics.}

  abstract={Robots fabricated by soft materials can provide higher flexibility and thus better safety while interacting with natural objects with low stiffness such as food and human beings. However, as many more degrees of freedom are introduced, the motion simulation of a soft robot becomes cumbersome, especially when large deformations are presented. Moreover, when the actuation is defined by geometry variation, it is not easy to obtain the exact loads and material properties to be used in the conventional methods of deformation simulation. In this paper, we present a direct approach to take the geometric actuation as input and compute the deformed shape of soft robots by numerical optimization using a geometry-based algorithm. By a simple calibration, the properties of multiple materials can be modeled geometrically in the framework. Numerical and experimental tests have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our approach on both cable-driven and pneumatic actuators in soft robotics.}

  abstract={Robots fabricated with soft materials can provide higher flexibility and, thus, better safety while interacting in unpredictable situations. However, the usage of soft material makes it challenging to predict the deformation of a continuum body under actuation and, therefore, brings difficulty to the kinematic control of its movement. In this article, we present a geometry-based framework for computing the deformation of soft robots within the range of linear material elasticity. After formulating both manipulators and actuators as geometry elements, deformation can be efficiently computed by solving a constrained optimization problem. Because of its efficiency, forward and inverse kinematics for soft manipulators can be solved by an iterative algorithm with a low computational cost. Meanwhile, components with multiple materials can also be geometrically modeled in our framework with the help of a simple calibration. Numerical and physical experimental tests are conducted on soft manipulators driven by different actuators with large deformation to demonstrate the performance of our approach.}

  abstract={One major concern regarding multi-material additive manufacturing (MMAM) is the strength at the interface between materials. Based on the observation of how nature puts materials together, this paper hypothesizes that overlapping and interlacing materials with each other enhance the interface bonding strength. To test this hypothesis, this research develops a new slicing framework that can efficiently identify the multi-material regions and develop interlaced infills. Based on a ray-tracing technology, we develop layered depth material images (LDMI) to process the material information of digital models for toolpath planning. Each sample point in the LDMI has an associated material and geometric properties that are used to recover the material distribution in each slice. With this material distribution, this work generates an interlocking joint and an interlacing infill in the regions with multiple materials. The experiments include comparisons between similar materials and different materials. Tensile tests have shown that our proposed infill outperforms the interlocking joint in all cases. Fractures occur even outside the interlacing area, meaning that the joint is at least as strong as the materials. The experimental results verify the enhancement of interface strength by overlapping and interlacing materials. In addition, existing computational tools have limitations in full use of material information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a slicer can process overlapped material regions and create interlacing infills. The interlacing infills improve the bonding strength, making the interface no longer the weakest area. This enables MMAM to fabricate truly functional parts. In addition, the new LDMI framework has rich information on geometry and material, and it allows future research in multi-material modeling.}

  abstract={Although additive manufacturing can produce nearly any geometry, users have limited choices in the designs. Topology optimization can create complex shapes, but it provides only one solution for one problem, and existing design exploration methods are ineffective when the design space is huge and high-dimensional. Therefore, this paper develops a new generative design method to improve the diversity of topology-optimized designs. Based on the observation that topology optimization places materials along the principal directions to maximize stiffness, this paper creates a rule of principal direction and applies it to swarm intelligence for form-finding. The shapes got by the swarming process possess both randomness and optimality. After they are further optimized, the final designs have high diversity. This is the first time integrating structural stiffness as a swarm principle to influence the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organized systems. The experimental results show that this method can generate interesting designs that have not been seen in the literature. Some results are even better than those got by the original topology optimization method, especially when the problem is more complex. This work not only allows users to choose unique designs according to their preference, but also helps users find better designs for their application.}

  abstract={To improve the surface properties of fiber-reinforced polymer composites, one method is to employ thermal spray to apply a coating on the composite. For this purpose, it uses a metal mesh serving as an anchor between the composite and the coating to increase adhesion. However, the composite manufacturing covers the metal mesh with resin, and getting an acceptable coating is only possible through an optimum exposure of the metal mesh by sand blasting prior to coating. Therefore, this study aims to develop a computer vision and image processing method to inspect the parts and provide the operator with feedback. Initially, this approach takes the images from a single-view microscope as the inputs, and then it classifies the images into two regions of resin and metal mesh using the Otsu’s adaptive thresholding. Next, it segments the resin areas into distinct connected clusters, and it makes a histogram based on the clusters’ size. Finally, the distribution of the histogram can determine the status of the surface preparation. The state-of-the-art has only examined the sand-blasted composites manually, requiring expertise and experience. This research presents a deterministic method to automate the inspection process efficiently with an inexpensive portable digital microscope. This method is practical, especially when there is a lack of standardized data for machine learning. The experimental results show that the method can get different histograms for various samples, and it can distinguish whether a sample is under-blasted, proper-blasted, or over-blasted successfully. This study also has applications to various fields of manufacturing for defect detection and closed-loop control.}

  abstract={With the advances in sensing and communication techniques, data collection has become much easier in manufacturing processes. Machine learning (ML) is a vital tool for manufacturing data analytics to leverage the underlying informatics carried by data. However, the varieties of data formats, dimensionality, and manufacturing types hugely hinder the learning efficiency of ML methods. Data preparation is critical for exploiting the potential of ML in manufacturing problems. This paper investigates how data preparation affects the ML efficacy in manufacturing data. Specifically, we study the influences of data normalization and dimension reduction on the ML performance for various types of manufacturing problems. We conduct comparison studies of data with/without pre-processing on different manufacturing processes, such as casting, milling, and additive manufacturing. Experimental results reveal that different pre-processing methods have a distinct effect on learning efficiency. Normalization is helpful for both numerical and image data, while dimension reduction — this paper uses principal component analysis (PCA) — is not useful for low-dimensional numerical manufacturing data. Combining both normalization and PCA can significantly enhance the learning efficiency of high-dimensional data. After that, we summarize several practical guidelines for manufacturing data preparation for ML, which provide a valuable basis for future manufacturing data analysis with ML approaches.}

However, most of our factories cannot operate remotely, and none can function without considerable human input and oversight. Trying to automate our factory highlights gaps in our technology, as it seems far behind our expectations, needs, and vision. Thus, this paper aims to fill this gap by showing how we have developed practical methodologies and applied technology to enhance legacy factories and their equipment. Specifically, we present the ORiON Production Interface (OPI) unit to run the factory as a smart networked edge device for virtually any machine or process. We have also implemented various computer vision algorithms in the OPI unit to detect errors autonomously, make decentralized decisions, and even control the quality. Although Industry 4.0 is a known concept to equip our factory to see, understand, and predict, we know that many machines today are closed source and cannot even communicate, let alone join a network. This research provides a workable solution to realize Industry 4.0 truly in existing factories with legacy equipment. Experimental results show that this system has a variety of applications, including process monitoring, part positioning, broken tool detection, etc. This novel intelligent networked system can enable our factories to be more innovative and responsive. It also allows for remote operations that can be unattended or lightly tended—a trend needed for the future.}

  abstract={Flexible sensor applications have increasingly focused on ionically conductive hydrogels due to their notable deformability and easily tunable properties compared to rigid materials. These hydrogels possess electrical properties, thanks to their high water content and porous structure that facilitate effective ion transfer. Despite their attractive features, hydrogels have limitations in terms of water retention and shape fidelity, and they are more typically inspected as two dimensional films and patches. In this paper, 3D printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) elastomer frames with various geometries were injected with ionic conductive polyacrylamide (PAAm) based hydrogels to create durable, robust soft mechanical sensors for detecting strain, pressure, and bending through changes in their electrical resistance. After the effectiveness of the TPU encasement in maintaining the hydrogel water content was demonstrated, hydrogel embedded frames with varying geometries were designed. Their response to mechanical loading was investigated in relation to their dimensions and geometric shape. Finally, glove-shaped frames were fabricated to fit human fingers and injected with ionic hydrogel for sensing abilities. The wearable sensors accommodated free movement of the fingers in multiple directions and were able to detect simultaneous and independent bending and stretching of the fingers. Through comprehensive observation of the electrical behavior of all soft ionic sensors in response to different kinds of mechanical stimuli, it was concluded that the resistance change following mechanical loading was dependent on the specific geometric features of each individual hybrid sensor. Thus, ionic hydrogel-embedded TPU encasement could be designed with targeted geometry to dictate the type and direction of mechanical sensing with regard to its application. This work presents a facile approach to fabricating multi-component soft geometric sensors with potential to be used for wearable electronics and human–machine interactions.}

  abstract={Obtaining the mechanical properties of 3D printed elastomers is a difficult task given the large variety of combinations with respect to materials and process parameters. Specifically, with Fused-Filament-Fabrication (FFF) printers, the tool path to lay-down lines of material can be modified for both the external and internal portions of the part. The internal structures are referred to as infill patterns and are akin to lattice structures. In this paper, we investigate the effect of infill pattern and infill density on both the working range of common elastomeric applications and the break characteristics. A commercial slicer is used to generate six patterns with a variety of shapes and different alignments to the tensile direction. With the infill patterns selected, the samples are printed using a FFF 3D printer at different infill densities. Finally, the properties of the samples are acquired through tensile tests. The characteristics at break, the inflection point, and the behavior of the working range are then presented and analyzed. Current literature on 3D printed structures mostly focuses on reporting break characteristics for different infill patterns, with no mention of its relationship to the working range. Additionally, lack of reproducibility of their results limits their applicability. As most common applications of elastomeric materials have a working range within 
 strain, the behavior within this region needs to be analyzed as well. This paper answers two hypotheses: increasing the density, regardless of infill pattern, will uniformly increase break characteristics; and increasing the break characteristics will similarly decrease the softening behavior of the eccentric elasticity zone. The paper presents three key findings. First, density’s relative effect on tensile properties increases as density increases. Second, the working range follows similar trends, in terms of strongest and weakest samples, to the break characteristics. However, the relative behavior of all samples in the working range remained constant regardless of pattern or density. Last, it was found that both the inflection point, where the elastomer goes from softening to stiffening, and the softening rate of the working range, are independent to infill pattern and density. Understanding the underlying effects of 3D printing parameters such as infill pattern and infill density can guide the generation of new patterns to address specific applications.}

  abstract={As we continue using plastics, the quantity of plastic waste also continues to pollute our land and oceans. To mitigate the plastic waste crisis, various manufacturing firms are trying to produce goods from recycled polymers. However, plastics often contain many additives and colorants, adding additional challenges to recycling. Removing these contaminates is necessary to increase the polymer’s recyclability and ensure that the recovered polymer still has economic value by restoring thermal and mechanical properties. One of the most popular, recyclable polymers is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). A widely used colorant in ABS is carbon black (CB) pigment, an insoluble inorganic pigment well dispersed throughout the polymer. Solvent-extraction methods have shown to be successful in restoring properties but also involve energy-intensive filtration steps to separate insoluble contaminants. This work uses a dissolution-precipitation process to dissolve ABS filament in ethyl acetate and polymerize it with methanol. A separation step was conducted to remove CB before precipitation by using a polar collector solvent to attract the hydroxyl group of the CB particles. Both ethylene glycol and distilled water were tested as collector solvents. The difference in density and miscibility between solvents allows for the CB pigment to be easily removed from the dissolved solution. Ethylene glycol was able to complete the separation method in less time than distilled water, thus more time efficient. The Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) results showed that the recovered samples remained ABS after completing the process. The Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) results indicated that there was no significant difference in the thermal decomposition behavior of the virgin ABS and the recovered samples when collector solvents were used to remove CB. This separation process helps purify the recycled polymer by eliminating contaminants such as pigments. As a result, the recycled material is suitable for a wider range of applications and meets industry standards, making them more attractive to consumers and manufacturers.}

  abstract = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) lead to fatigue and decreased productivity in workers, resulting in the need for many affected individuals to seek medical treatment annually. Beekeepers, like other agricultural workers, are susceptible to WRMSDs due to the continuous demands of their work and the repetitive movements involved. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of WRMSDs and assess the level of risk associated with different postures among beekeepers to improve their musculoskeletal health. To achieve this, a cross-sectional study was conducted involving 33 beekeepers, consisting of two stages. Firstly, the Nordic Questionnaire was utilized to assess the prevalence of WRMSDs. Subsequently, the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS) was employed to analyze and categorize the riskiest postures into four levels of corrective measures. The findings indicate that the most commonly affected areas were the back (51.5%) and waist (45.4%). The occurrence of WRMSDs in various body regions was significantly associated with the beekeepers’ years of experience and weekly working hours. Additionally, the prevalence of neck and back pain was significantly related to their body mass index (BMI). The OWAS postural analysis revealed that the back (36.75%) and arm (21.08%) regions required corrective measures as soon as possible (level III), while the back (26.47%) and legs (14.70%) fell under the category of corrective measures needed in the near future (level II). Combining the postural analysis results, 28.43% were classified as Action Levels (AL) II, 37.73% as level III, and 0.98% as level IV. This study demonstrates that WRMSDs are relatively common among beekeepers, primarily due to their extensive work experience and the adoption of awkward postures during their tasks. As a result, recommendations regarding ergonomics and physiotherapy are provided to alleviate pain and reduce the strain on critical postures.}

  abstract={This study introduces a novel approach to enhance the surface properties of fiber-reinforced polymer composites through thermal spray coatings, utilizing a metal mesh as an anchor to improve coating adhesion. A critical step in this process is achieving optimal exposure of the metal mesh by sandblasting prior to coating. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop control system designed to inspect and blast parts effectively. Our method leverages top-view microscope images as inputs, employing a convolutional neural network (CNN) to correlate these images with the corresponding exposure levels of the metal mesh, measured via a destructive method. Upon training, the CNN model accurately estimates the exposure level solely from the top-view images, facilitating real-time feedback to guide subsequent sandblasting operations. Unlike traditional manual inspection methods, which demand expertise and experience, our automated approach streamlines the inspection process using a cost-effective portable digital microscope. Experimental findings validate the efficacy of our method in successfully discerning surface preparation status with an accuracy rate of 95% and demonstrate its practical utility in closed-loop control. Our study not only offers a robust methodology for quantifying surface preparation data but also presents a significant advancement in automating the inspection process. Moreover, the broader implications of our approach extend to various manufacturing sectors, where defect detection and closed-loop control are crucial for optimizing production efficiency and product quality.

No single approach exists to design a midsole that meets all these objectives effectively. Therefore, this study aims to introduce a multidisciplinary optimization method to develop custom shoe midsole structures. Our approach involves utilizing generative methods to generate diverse structures and leveraging swarm intelligence to search for optimal designs. Without loss of generality, we use tetrahedral mesh generation to create midsole structures because tetrahedral structures are renowned for their exceptional strength. To enhance the swarm’s exploration of the design space and discover more local optima, we developed a swarm behavior that promotes diversity. Furthermore, we created a quantitative measurement tool to evaluate various objectives. In order to test the effectiveness of our generative approach, we analyzed the midsoles generated from our design exploration that performed the best and the worst in relation to each objective. Our findings revealed a substantial difference between them, with scores differing by two to four times. Additionally, when compared to other lattice structures, the tetrahedral midsole structure created by our method demonstrated superior compliance with the foot and better redistribution of plantar stress. The multidisciplinary optimization technique we have proposed is a valuable resource for engineers and designers in the footwear industry, allowing them to develop high-performance midsole structures that meet the needs of both consumers and athletes. Furthermore, this method can be applied to optimize other complex structures in various industries, such as civil, automotive, and aerospace engineering.}
