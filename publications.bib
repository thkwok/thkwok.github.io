  abstract = {Due to the recent pandemic, our factory operations have experienced significant setbacks, prompting the need for factory automation to maintain productivity. However, most of our factories rely heavily on human input and oversight and cannot operate remotely. Automating our factories has revealed technological gaps that fall short of our expectations, needs, and vision. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to bridge this gap by introducing practical methodologies and applied technology that can enhance legacy factories and their equipment. Our proposed solution is the ORiON Production Interface (OPI) unit, which can function as a smart networked edge device for virtually any machine, allowing the factory to operate efficiently. We have incorporated various computer vision algorithms into the OPI unit, enabling it to autonomously detect errors, make decentralized decisions, and control quality. Despite the concept of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) being known, many machines in use today are closed source and unable to communicate or join a network. Our research offers a viable solution to implement Industry 4.0 in existing factories, and experimental results have demonstrated various applications such as process monitoring, part positioning, and broken tool detection. Our intelligent networked system is novel and enables factories to be more innovative and responsive, ultimately leading to enhanced productivity. All manufacturing companies interested in adopting Industry 4.0 technology can benefit from it, and the OPI, being an IoT device, is also an appealing option for developers and hobbyists alike.}

  abstract = {Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs) lead to fatigue and decreased productivity in workers, resulting in the need for many affected individuals to seek medical treatment annually. Beekeepers, like other agricultural workers, are susceptible to WRMSDs due to the continuous demands of their work and the repetitive movements involved. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of WRMSDs and assess the level of risk associated with different postures among beekeepers to improve their musculoskeletal health. To achieve this, a cross-sectional study was conducted involving 33 beekeepers, consisting of two stages. Firstly, the Nordic Questionnaire was utilized to assess the prevalence of WRMSDs. Subsequently, the Ovako Working Posture Analysis System (OWAS) was employed to analyze and categorize the riskiest postures into four levels of corrective measures. The findings indicate that the most commonly affected areas were the back (51.5%) and waist (45.4%). The occurrence of WRMSDs in various body regions was significantly associated with the beekeepers’ years of experience and weekly working hours. Additionally, the prevalence of neck and back pain was significantly related to their body mass index (BMI). The OWAS postural analysis revealed that the back (36.75%) and arm (21.08%) regions required corrective measures as soon as possible (level III), while the back (26.47%) and legs (14.70%) fell under the category of corrective measures needed in the near future (level II). Combining the postural analysis results, 28.43% were classified as Action Levels (AL) II, 37.73% as level III, and 0.98% as level IV. This study demonstrates that WRMSDs are relatively common among beekeepers, primarily due to their extensive work experience and the adoption of awkward postures during their tasks. As a result, recommendations regarding ergonomics and physiotherapy are provided to alleviate pain and reduce the strain on critical postures.}
